# IS213-Itinerary

Odysseyâ€™s Itineraries is created as a platform to deliver the ease of travelling to the users. The main objective of the solution is to ensure that past itineraries will not go to waste while potential travellers can obtain itineraries easy and hassle free.
Planning for a trip takes a significant amount from as little as a few weeks to a longer period of a year or so. Part of the planning process involves sourcing for places to go to according to the goal of your trip. We aim to shorten this process for prospective travellers while allowing people to reuse their past itineraries.
