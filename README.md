# IS213-Itinerary

Odysseyâ€™s Itineraries is created as a platform to deliver the ease of travelling to the users. The main objective of the solution is to ensure that past itineraries will not go to waste while potential travellers can obtain itineraries easy and hassle free.
Planning for a trip takes a significant amount from as little as a few weeks to a longer period of a year or so. Part of the planning process involves sourcing for places to go to according to the goal of your trip. We aim to shorten this process for prospective travellers while allowing people to reuse their past itineraries.

To get Odyssey up and running on your system:

Ensure the following is turned on and running: WAMP/MAMP, Docker

You will need the following folder, itinerary, which contains the codes upon which Odyssey runs on. There are 2 ways to get the folder itinerary.

Navigate to the folder **IS213-Itinerary\www** to find itinerary folder

### Via elearn

<hr>

Move the itinerary folder into -> **wamp64\www\**<br>
Open a Terminal at **wamp64\www\itinerary**<br>
Run the command: **docker-compose up**, wait till command is executed completely<br>
Import the SQL files found at **wamp64\www\itinerary\sql** into your local database<br>
